Western Washington University ACM Hackathon 2019\
Project: Network with honeypot, IDS, and ELK stack.\
The IDS was built with Bash. The project included connecting a bunch of home routers together (god bless Sam for updating all the old software and getting them connected) and then designating a machine as the honeypot, and detecting the intrusion with the IDS and ELK stack.

Contributers: Sam "SamSlamDunky" Dinkleman, Scarlette "UpperEastside" Anderson, John "DoYouWantASnack?" Traner, Josh "OhCaptainMyCaptain" Stuifbergen
